# iangaunt/web-skeleton/preact

A variant on the web-skeleton master branch that is built using Preact instead of React as a more efficient alternative, but may require insight into alternate syntax for React-DOM manipulation. The provided `package.json` file contains linting for SCSS and TypeScript files.

All the `npm` commands are exactly the same as in the master. Information on specific commands can be found in the README on the master.

## Cloning

For simple cloning of the repo, run:
```git clone -b preact https://github.com/iangaunt/web-skeleton.git```
